## üöÄ How It Works

### Task Creation Flow

```
1. User creates task via UI
   ‚Üì
2. Task saved to agent_task_queue with status='pending'
   ‚Üì
3. Background worker picks up task
   ‚Üì
4. If credentials needed ‚Üí Create credential_request
   ‚Üì
5. User provides credentials
   ‚Üì
6. Task executes step-by-step
   ‚Üì
7. Each step logged to agent_task_executions
   ‚Üì
8. Progress updated in real-time
   ‚Üì
9. Result saved, notification created
   ‚Üì
10. User sees completion in UI
```

### Credential Request Flow

```
1. AI needs login credentials
   ‚Üì
2. credential_request created
   ‚Üì
3. Notification sent to user
   ‚Üì
4. User provides credentials via UI
   ‚Üì
5. Credentials encrypted and saved
   ‚Üì
6. Task execution resumes
   ‚Üì
7. Credentials reused for future tasks
```

### Email Sending Flow

```
1. Task requires sending email
   ‚Üì
2. Email composed by AI
   ‚Üì
3. Email log created (requires_approval=true)
   ‚Üì
4. User approves email (optional)
   ‚Üì
5. Email sent via provider
   ‚Üì
6. Delivery status logged
   ‚Üì
7. User notified of send result
```

```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Available Metrics
- Tasks created per day
- Success/failure rates
- Average execution time
- Most common task types
- Credential usage frequency
- Email delivery rates

### Database Queries

**Active tasks:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_task_queue
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'awaiting_credentials')
ORDER BY priority DESC, scheduled_for ASC;
```

**Task success rate:**
```sql
SELECT
  task_type,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM agent_task_queue
GROUP BY task_type;
```

**Average execution time:**
```sql
SELECT
  task_type,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - started_at))) as avg_seconds
FROM agent_task_queue
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY task_type;
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Variables

**Backend:**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
JWT_SECRET_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...  # For email sending
ENCRYPTION_KEY=...     # For credential encryption
```

**Frontend:**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Running the System

**1. Apply Database Migration:**
```bash
# Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or manually apply:
# supabase/migrations/20251020050000_autonomous_task_execution.sql
```

**2. Start Backend with Worker:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# Worker starts automatically via lifespan event
```

**3. Frontend Already Running:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

### Production Considerations

1. **Worker Scaling:** Run multiple worker instances with distributed locks
2. **Encryption:** Use HSM or KMS for key management
3. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent API abuse on health portals
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for failed tasks
5. **Backup:** Regular database backups with point-in-time recovery
