# EverAfter - Final Summary

## Project Overview
EverAfter delivers a compassionate family dashboard that captures daily reflections, visualises progress, and prepares families for hologram projection sessions. The experience includes demo fallbacks so teams can explore the workflow without immediate backend setup.

## Delivered Outcomes
- **Reoriented dashboard** around the daily prompt workflow, guardian management, Saints AI summaries, projection planning, privacy posture, and automation toggles
- **Projection planning suite** with hardware readiness, configurable session console, and a comprehensive hologram guide
- **Supabase-aware hooks** that gracefully fall back to demo data while maintaining persistence paths for production use
- **Documentation refresh** across README, setup, implementation, deployment, and verification guides to reflect the current architecture
- **Tooling stability** by pinning TypeScript 5.5.4 for ESLint compatibility and recommending `npm ci` for dependency installation

## Key Files
- `src/App.tsx`: Application shell orchestrating landing and dashboard states
- `src/components/dashboard/FamilyDashboard.tsx`: Main dashboard tabs, metrics, and workflows
- `src/components/dashboard/ProjectionControlPanel.tsx`: Session planning console and hardware checks
- `src/components/HologramGuide.tsx`: Seven-phase hologram blueprint with pillars and readiness checks
- `src/hooks/useDashboard.ts`: Dashboard data orchestration with demo mode seeding and Supabase persistence

## Verification
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Manual demo-mode walkthrough across all dashboard tabs

## Next Steps
- Persist projection sessions and automation toggles to Supabase tables
- Extend the experience with a dedicated memory timeline powered by `useMemories`
- Integrate Saints AI automations and notifications when backend services are available
- Expand privacy and settings panels into fully editable, persistent forms

All assets are ready for continued development or deployment.
