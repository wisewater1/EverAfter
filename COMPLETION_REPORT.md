# EverAfter - Completion Report

## Executive Summary
The EverAfter dashboard has been rebuilt around the daily reflection workflow, Saints AI companions, and hologram projection planning. Documentation and tooling now reflect the streamlined experience and the pinned tooling stack.

## Achievements

### Application Architecture
- Simplified shell that routes between the landing hero and authenticated dashboard based on Supabase configuration
- Header with Wheel of Samsara branding, live status indicator, and optional back navigation
- Demo mode seeding ensures a fully interactive experience without external services

### Dashboard Highlights
- **Overview tab**: Daily question capture, journey metrics, and recent activity feed
- **Family Members tab**: Guardian roster with invitation form, status chips, and success feedback
- **Saints AI tab**: Card deck describing each guardianâ€™s remit with activity counters
- **Projection tab**: Hardware readiness summary, projection session console, and hologram blueprint
- **Privacy tab**: Snapshot of device trust, encryption posture, and readiness checklist
- **Settings tab**: Automation toggles illustrating digest, alerting, and reminders

### Memory Capture & Persistence
- `DailyQuestionCard` adapts prompts per time of day and personality aspect, with inline encouragement for richer stories
- `useDashboard.saveMemory` persists entries to Supabase when configured and mutates demo state otherwise
- `useMemories` exposes reusable CRUD helpers for future timelines or galleries

### Projection Planning Toolkit
- `ProjectionControlPanel` schedules sessions with focus presets, playlists, voice profiles, and safety notes
- Status badge confirms staging success while a hardware checklist tracks power, network, and projector diagnostics
- `HologramGuide` outlines seven production phases, key technology pillars, and readiness checks for families

### Tooling & Infrastructure
- Supabase client centralised in `lib/supabase.ts` with configuration guard
- TypeScript locked at 5.5.4 to stay within the supported @typescript-eslint range
- Tailwind CSS and Lucide React drive consistent, accessible styling

### Documentation Refresh
- README, setup guide, deployment checklist, verification report, and implementation summary rewritten to match the current feature set
- Emphasis on demo mode behaviour and recommended `npm ci` flow for dependency consistency

## Quality Verification
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Manual smoke test in demo mode covering all dashboard tabs

## Outstanding Opportunities
- Persist projection plans and automation toggles via Supabase tables
- Build a dedicated memory timeline leveraging `useMemories`
- Integrate Saints AI automations when backing services are available
- Expand privacy settings into editable controls with persistence
