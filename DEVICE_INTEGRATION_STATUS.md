## 🔧 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue #1: Database Migration Order
**Problem**: New migrations must be applied in correct order
**Solution**: Migrations are numbered sequentially and will auto-apply
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue #2: Edge Function Deployment
**Problem**: Edge functions need to be deployed to Supabase
**Solution**: Functions are created locally, need manual deployment via Supabase CLI or dashboard
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires deployment step

### Issue #3: Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: Edge functions need OpenAI API key for analytics
**Solution**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Supabase project secrets
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### 1. Database Migrations
```bash
# Migrations will auto-apply on next Supabase connection
# Verify migrations are applied:
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
WHERE version >= '20251027030000'
ORDER BY version DESC;
```

### 2. Edge Functions Deployment
```bash
# Deploy device-stream-handler
supabase functions deploy device-stream-handler

# Deploy predictive-health-analytics
supabase functions deploy predictive-health-analytics
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI-powered analytics
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Auto-configured
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Auto-configured
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Auto-configured

### 4. Frontend Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Device Registry
```sql
-- Should return 25+ devices
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM device_registry;

-- Check device types
SELECT device_type, COUNT(*)
FROM device_registry
GROUP BY device_type;
```

### Test 2: Transformation Rules
```sql
-- Should return 50+ rules
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data_transformation_rules;

-- Check LOINC mappings
SELECT standard_metric_name, loinc_code
FROM data_transformation_rules
WHERE loinc_code IS NOT NULL;
```

### Test 3: Device Monitor Dashboard
1. Navigate to Health Dashboard
2. Click "Devices" tab
3. Should see empty state: "No devices connected yet"
4. Status summary should show all zeros

### Test 4: Predictive Analytics
1. Navigate to Health Dashboard
2. Click "Predictions" tab
3. Should see: "Insufficient data for analysis" (expected with no data)

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- ✅ Health Dashboard - New tabs added
- ✅ RaphaelChat - Can access device data
- ✅ HealthAnalytics - Can query device metrics
- ✅ Emergency Contacts - Integrated with alerts

### New Capabilities
- Real-time device monitoring
- Predictive health analytics
- Automated alert generation
- Multi-device correlation analysis
- Clinical data standardization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Device not showing in dashboard"
**Cause**: Device connection not properly created
**Fix**: Ensure device_connections record exists with valid device_registry_id

### Problem: "No data quality metrics"
**Cause**: No data has been ingested yet
**Fix**: Wait for devices to send data, or manually insert test data

### Problem: "Predictions not loading"
**Cause**: Insufficient historical data (need 7+ days)
**Fix**: System requires minimum 7 data points per metric

### Problem: "Alerts not triggering"
**Cause**: Alert thresholds not configured
**Fix**: Set thresholds in device_connections.preferences field

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these KPIs to measure system health:

1. **Device Connectivity**
   - Target: >95% uptime for connected devices
   - Query: `SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN connection_status = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM device_connections;`

2. **Data Quality**
   - Target: >90% quality score average
   - Query: `SELECT AVG(quality_score) FROM data_quality_logs WHERE recorded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';`

3. **Alert Response Time**
   - Target: <5 minutes from trigger to acknowledgment
   - Query: `SELECT AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (acknowledged_at - triggered_at))) FROM device_alerts WHERE acknowledged_at IS NOT NULL;`

4. **Prediction Accuracy**
   - Target: 70%+ confidence in predictions
   - Query: Track via predictive-health-analytics function results

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented Protections
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ User can only access own devices
- ✅ Service role for webhook ingestion
- ✅ Data encryption at rest
- ✅ Secure token handling

### Audit Requirements
- All device access logged
- Alert notifications tracked
- Data quality validation recorded
- Emergency contact notifications logged

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review alert patterns and adjust thresholds
2. **Monthly**: Analyze prediction accuracy and retrain models
3. **Quarterly**: Update device registry with new models
4. **As needed**: Add transformation rules for new metrics

### Monitoring Dashboards
- Device health scores
- Data quality trends
- Alert frequency
- User engagement metrics

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Deploy edge functions to production
2. Set environment variables
3. Test with real device data
4. Configure alert thresholds

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Onboard first batch of devices
2. Train staff on monitoring dashboard
3. Establish baseline metrics
4. Fine-tune prediction algorithms

### Long-term (Quarter 1)
