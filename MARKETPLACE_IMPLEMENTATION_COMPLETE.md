# EverAfter AI Marketplace - Implementation Complete

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive autonomous AI marketplace for EverAfter, transforming your static marketplace into a fully functional system where creators can publish AI templates, users can discover and purchase them, and agents run autonomously with memory and task execution.
