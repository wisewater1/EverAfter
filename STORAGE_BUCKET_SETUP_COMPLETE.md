## 📋 Storage Policies Configuration

Storage policies need to be configured through the Supabase Dashboard. Here's how:

### Option 1: Configure via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Storage**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/storage/buckets
   - Click on the `user-files` bucket

2. **Configure Policies**
   - Click on "Policies" tab
   - Click "New Policy"
   - Add the following 4 policies:

#### Policy 1: Allow Upload
```sql
-- Name: Users can upload files to own folder
-- Policy command: INSERT
-- Target roles: authenticated

WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (SELECT position(
    (split_part(auth.email(), '@', 1) || '-' || substring(auth.uid()::text, 1, 8))
    in name
  )) = 1
)
```

#### Policy 2: Allow Read
```sql
-- Name: Users can view own files
-- Policy command: SELECT
-- Target roles: authenticated

USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (SELECT position(
    (split_part(auth.email(), '@', 1) || '-' || substring(auth.uid()::text, 1, 8))
    in name
  )) = 1
)
```

#### Policy 3: Allow Update
```sql
-- Name: Users can update own files
-- Policy command: UPDATE
-- Target roles: authenticated

USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (SELECT position(
    (split_part(auth.email(), '@', 1) || '-' || substring(auth.uid()::text, 1, 8))
    in name
  )) = 1
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (SELECT position(
    (split_part(auth.email(), '@', 1) || '-' || substring(auth.uid()::text, 1, 8))
    in name
  )) = 1
)
```

#### Policy 4: Allow Delete
```sql
-- Name: Users can delete own files
-- Policy command: DELETE
-- Target roles: authenticated

USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (SELECT position(
    (split_part(auth.email(), '@', 1) || '-' || substring(auth.uid()::text, 1, 8))
    in name
  )) = 1
)
```

### Option 2: Use Without Policies (For Testing)

If you want to test the health report generation immediately:

1. **Temporarily disable RLS on the bucket** (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)
2. Or simply turn off the "Save to Cloud Storage" toggle in the Health Report Generator
3. Reports will still download to your device successfully

### Option 3: Simple Open Policy (For Development Only)

For quick testing, you can add a permissive policy:

```sql
-- DEVELOPMENT ONLY - Allow all authenticated users full access
CREATE POLICY "Dev: Allow all authenticated users"
ON storage.objects
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'user-files')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'user-files');
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: This allows all users to access all files. Only use for development!

## 🎯 How It Works

### File Organization
Files are organized by user email prefix and user ID:
```
user-files/
  └── john-a1b2c3d4/          # User's folder (email prefix + first 8 chars of user ID)
      ├── health_report/
      │   ├── 1234567890-health-report-2025-10-01-to-2025-10-27.html
      │   └── 1234567891-health-report-2025-10-20-to-2025-10-27.html
      ├── document/
      │   └── medical-records.pdf
      └── image/
          └── profile-photo.jpg
```

### Security Model
- Each user can only access files in their own folder
- Folder name is derived from email + user ID (e.g., `john-a1b2c3d4`)
- RLS policies check that the file path starts with the user's prefix
- Files are private by default (not publicly accessible)

## 🔧 Testing the Integration

### Test Health Report Generation

1. **Navigate to Health Dashboard**
   - Go to the Health tab in your EverAfter app
   - Click on "Reports" or use Quick Actions → "Generate Report"

2. **Generate a Report**
   - Select report type (Weekly, Monthly, or Custom)
   - Toggle "Save to Cloud Storage" ON
   - Click "Generate & Save Report"

3. **Expected Results**
   - Report downloads to your device ✅
   - If policies are configured: "Report downloaded and saved to cloud!"
   - If policies not configured: "Report downloaded successfully!" (cloud save fails silently)

4. **Verify Cloud Storage** (if policies configured)
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → user-files bucket
   - You should see your files under your user folder

## 📊 Storage Management

### Monitor Usage

```sql
-- Get total storage used per user
SELECT
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] as user_folder,
  COUNT(*) as file_count,
  pg_size_pretty(SUM(metadata->>'size')::bigint) as total_size
FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'user-files'
GROUP BY user_folder
ORDER BY SUM(metadata->>'size')::bigint DESC;
```

### Cleanup Old Files

```sql
-- Find files older than 90 days
SELECT name, created_at
FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'user-files'
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

## 🚀 Production Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] Storage policies configured via Dashboard
- [ ] Tested file upload with authenticated user
- [ ] Tested file download/delete
- [ ] Verified users can only access their own files
- [ ] Set up storage quota monitoring
- [ ] Configure backup strategy for important files
- [ ] Document retention policy for health reports

## 💡 Tips

1. **Development**: Use "Save to Cloud Storage" toggle OFF for faster testing
2. **Production**: Enable cloud storage for better user experience
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for storage quota approaching limits
4. **Cleanup**: Implement automated cleanup of old reports (optional)

## ✅ What Works Now

Even without configuring policies:

1. ✅ Health report generation works perfectly
2. ✅ Reports download to user's device
3. ✅ All health data included in reports
4. ✅ No errors or crashes
5. ⚠️ Cloud storage will fail gracefully (non-critical)

With policies configured:

1. ✅ Everything above PLUS
2. ✅ Reports saved to cloud
3. ✅ Access via File Manager
4. ✅ Download from any device
5. ✅ Secure, isolated storage per user

**Status**: ✅ Bucket Created
**Next Step**: Configure policies via Dashboard (optional)
**Feature**: Fully Functional (with or without policies)
