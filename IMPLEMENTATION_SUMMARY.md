# Implementation Summary - EverAfter Application

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Application Shell & Navigation
- Single-page shell in `App.tsx` that toggles between the landing hero and the authenticated family dashboard
- Header with logo/back navigation and live status indicator
- Auth hook detects Supabase configuration and injects a demo user when credentials are absent

### 2. Dashboard Experience
- `FamilyDashboard` orchestrates six tabs: Overview, Family Members, Saints AI, Projection, Privacy, and Settings
- Overview tab pairs the `DailyQuestionCard` with progress stats and recent activity feed
- Family tab manages guardians with invitation workflow and status chips
- Saints AI tab introduces three guardian personas with activity counters
- Privacy and Settings tabs summarise safeguards and automation toggles for quick review

### 3. Memory Capture Pipeline
- `DailyQuestionCard` draws from `data/questions.ts`, adapting prompts to the current day and time slot
- Questions include difficulty badges, personality context, and dynamic encouragement once entries become detailed
- Memory submissions are routed through `useDashboard.saveMemory`, persisting to Supabase when available or updating demo state otherwise

### 4. Projection Planning Suite
- `ProjectionControlPanel` lets coordinators plan upcoming sessions (location, focus, playlists, voice, guests, and safety notes)
- Hardware readiness checklist surfaces power, network, and projector diagnostics
- `HologramGuide` documents the seven-phase journey from data capture to on-site stewardship, with technology pillars and readiness checks

### 5. Data & Auth Hooks
- `useAuth` encapsulates Supabase auth flows and provides a demo identity fallback
- `useDashboard` centralises dashboard stats, family roster, and activity feed with memoised demo seeding
- `useMemories` exposes reusable CRUD helpers for future timelines or galleries

### 6. Infrastructure & Tooling
- Supabase client configured in `lib/supabase.ts` with a helper to detect configuration
- TypeScript dev dependency pinned to 5.5.4 for compatibility with the ESLint toolchain
- Tailwind CSS powers utility-first styling; Lucide React supplies iconography

### 7. Documentation Refresh
- README and setup guides updated to reflect the streamlined dashboard, projection console, and demo behaviour
- Deployment checklist and verification notes rewritten around the current feature set

## Testing & Quality
- `npm run lint` ensures code health with the pinned TypeScript toolchain
- `npm run build` validates production readiness with Vite
- Demo mode exercised to confirm UI remains functional without Supabase credentials

## Next Opportunities
- Persist projection plans through Supabase once backend schema is ready
- Add a dedicated memory timeline leveraging the existing `useMemories` hook
- Integrate Saints AI automation once services are wired to Supabase tables
- Expand privacy tooling into editable settings with persistence
