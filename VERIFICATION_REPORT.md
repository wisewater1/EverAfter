## Observations
- Demo mode delivers immediate value for stakeholders previewing flows without provisioning Supabase
- Projection planning copy emphasises safety, consent, and operational readiness for families
- The dashboard is ready for future persistence work (projection plans, automation toggles, saints activity logs)

## Pending Enhancements

- Introduce a chronological memory timeline using `useMemories`
- Expand privacy tab into editable policies once backend support is available

All verification steps above have been executed, and the repository is ready for continued development or deployment.
