# Working Login Credentials

## ✅ AUTHENTICATION IS WORKING

The login system works correctly! Here are the findings from my testing:

## Working Test Account

**Email:** `test-1761409092397@example.com`
**Password:** `StrongP@ssw0rd2024!ComplexEnough`

This account was created via the normal signup flow and works perfectly for login.

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works

1. **Normal Signup Flow** - Creating users through the standard signup page at `/signup` works perfectly
2. **Login** - Users created via signup can login successfully at `/login`
3. **Password Strength** - Supabase requires strong passwords (the simple `TestPassword123!` is rejected as too weak)
4. **Email Confirmation** - Auto-confirmation is working via the database trigger
5. **Session Management** - Sessions are created properly and authentication state persists

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**Manual User Creation** - The `create_user_manually()` database function creates users that cannot login.

**Error:** "Database error querying schema" (HTTP 500)

**Root Cause:** Despite matching all visible fields (password hash format, metadata structure, identity records), manually created users trigger an internal Supabase Auth error during login. This suggests Supabase Auth has internal validation or schema expectations that aren't satisfied when users are created via direct SQL INSERT.

## Recommendations

### For Development/Testing

**Use the normal signup flow:**

1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Enter a valid email address
3. Create a **strong password** (avoid common passwords, use mix of characters, numbers, symbols)
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to `/dashboard`

### For Production

The signup flow is working correctly. The `/admin/create-user` page exists but creates users that cannot login due to Supabase Auth's internal requirements.

**Options:**

1. **Enable Public Signup** - Let users create their own accounts (recommended)
2. **Use Supabase Dashboard** - Create users manually through the Supabase web interface
3. **Use Supabase Admin API** - Implement proper admin user creation using Supabase's official Admin API (not raw SQL)

## Password Requirements

Based on testing, passwords must be:
- ✅ Sufficiently complex (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Not in common password lists
- ❌ Simple patterns like `TestPassword123!` are rejected

**Example of accepted password:** `StrongP@ssw0rd2024!ComplexEnough`

## Testing the Login

### Method 1: Use the Web Interface

```bash
# Start the dev server (if not already running)
npm run dev

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:5173/login

# Use credentials:
Email: test-1761409092397@example.com
Password: StrongP@ssw0rd2024!ComplexEnough
```

### Method 2: Create a New Test Account

```bash
# Navigate to:
http://localhost:5173/signup

# Create account with:
Email: your-email@example.com
Password: [Strong password following guidelines above]

# You'll be automatically logged in
```

## Status Summary

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Signup Flow | ✅ Working | Create new accounts at `/signup` |
| Login Flow | ✅ Working | Login at `/login` with signup-created accounts |
| Email Confirmation | ✅ Working | Auto-confirmed via database trigger |
| Session Management | ✅ Working | Sessions persist correctly |
| Password Reset | ⚠️ Unknown | Not tested |
| Manual User Creation | ❌ Not Working | Users cannot login |
| Admin Dashboard | ⚠️ Incomplete | Create-user function doesn't work for auth |

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Use the working signup flow for creating test accounts
2. ✅ Login works with accounts created via signup
3. ⚠️ Either remove the `/admin/create-user` page or implement it using Supabase Admin API
4. ⚠️ Consider adding password strength indicator on signup page
5. ⚠️ Test password reset flow if needed
