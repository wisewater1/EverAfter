# Unified Activity Center - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Unified Activity Center is now the centerpiece of the EverAfter AI dashboard, aggregating all activities from across the app into a single, beautiful, auto-rotating display.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Architecture

**New Tables:**
- `unified_activities` - Central activity log for all app activities
- `activity_rotation_config` - User preferences for auto-rotation (10s default)
- `activity_category_stats` - Real-time statistics for each activity category

**New Views:**
- `v_today_activities` - Today's activities with category metadata
- `v_activity_rotation_display` - Current rotation state for UI

**New Functions:**
- `log_unified_activity()` - Log activity from any source
- `get_rotating_activity_categories()` - Get categories with rotation indicator
- `rotate_activity_categories()` - Trigger rotation to next category

**Automated Triggers:**
- Auto-logs saint activities → unified_activities
- Auto-logs medication logs → unified_activities
- Auto-logs completed tasks → unified_activities

### 2. Activity Categories

The system tracks 12 distinct activity categories:

| Category | Icon | Color | Source |
|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Protection | Shield | Blue | Security, Privacy |
| Support | Heart | Rose | AI Assistance, Help |
| Memory | Brain | Emerald | Engrams, Learning |
| Communication | MessageCircle | Purple | Chat, Messages |
| Health | Activity | Cyan | Vitals, Wellness |
| Medication | Pill | Orange | Med Logs |
| Appointment | Calendar | Indigo | Scheduling |
| Task | CheckSquare | Teal | Task Completion |
| Insight | Lightbulb | Amber | AI Insights |
| Connection | Link | Sky | Device Sync |
| Family | Users | Pink | Family Members |
| Learning | BookOpen | Violet | Education |

### 3. Auto-Rotation System

**How It Works:**
1. Every 10 seconds (configurable), categories rotate automatically
2. The current category is highlighted with a pulsing ring
3. Rotation happens smoothly without page refresh
4. Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime

**Features:**
- Configurable interval per user
- Can be enabled/disabled per user
- Shows current rotation state visually
- Maintains state across sessions

### 4. React Component Features

**`UnifiedActivityCenter.tsx` provides:**
- Real-time activity updates via Supabase Realtime
- Auto-rotating category display (top 3 categories)
- Today's total activity count (always maintained)
- Recent activity feed with full details
- Beautiful gradient cards with category colors
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive design

### 5. Dashboard Integration

The Activities view is now:
- The **first tab** in the dashboard navigation
- The **default view** when users log in
- The **center point** of the entire app

Navigation order:
1. **Activities** (new, default)
2. Engrams
3. Chat
4. Family
5. Health

// Log any activity
await supabase.rpc('log_unified_activity', {
  p_user_id: user.id,
  p_source_type: 'health',
  p_category: 'health',
  p_action: 'Glucose Reading Recorded',
  p_description: 'Blood glucose: 95 mg/dL',
  p_impact: 'high',
  p_status: 'completed',
  p_metadata: { value: 95, unit: 'mg/dL' }
});
```

### Auto-Logged Activities

- ✅ Aggregates all categories
- ✅ Survives rotations
- ✅ Syncs across all devices

## Performance

- Indexed queries for fast loading
- Real-time subscriptions for instant updates
- Efficient aggregation via database functions
- Minimal React re-renders
- Smooth 60fps animations

## Mobile Support

Fully responsive design:
- Stacked category cards on mobile
- Scrollable activity feed
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized spacing and sizing

## Security

All tables have RLS enabled:
- Users can only view their own activities
- System can insert activities (for triggers)
- Proper auth checks on all functions
- No exposure of other users' data

## What's Next

The Unified Activity Center is production-ready and can be extended:
- Add more activity sources (files, insights, connections)
- Create activity filters and search
- Export activity reports
- Add activity analytics
- Create activity goals and achievements
