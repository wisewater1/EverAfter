## ✅ Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

All authentication features have been implemented and tested successfully.

### 3. Login System

## Working Test Credentials

**Email:** demo@everafter.com  
**Password:** DemoPassword2024!Strong

## Quick Test

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Test login at:
http://localhost:5173/login

# Use the credentials above
```

## All Features

| Feature | Status | URL |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Signup | ✅ Working | `/signup` |
| Login | ✅ Working | `/login` |
| Forgot Password | ✅ Working | `/forgot-password` |
| Reset Password | ✅ Working | `/reset-password` |
| Dashboard | ✅ Protected | `/dashboard` |

## Important Notes

1. **Passwords must be strong** - Use mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
2. **Email auto-confirmation** - No need to check email after signup
3. **Session persistence** - Users stay logged in across refreshes
4. **Protected routes** - Dashboard requires authentication

## Files Modified

- Created: `src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx`
- Created: `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx`
- Updated: `src/App.tsx` (added routes)
- Updated: `LOGIN_CREDENTIALS.md` (documentation)
